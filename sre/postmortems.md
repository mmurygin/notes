# Postmortem

## Basic
1. Real incidents
    *  Real incidents are not unusual.
    *  Real incidents are not all catastrophic issues - conduct postmortems for minor issues as well.
    *  Real incidents do not have a single, simple root cause. Contributing Factors!
    *  Postmortems are to learn, not to fix.
1. **Postmortem** - taking the opportunity to learn how your system really does work, after your system acts differently from how you expect it to, in order to increase your system and team's resilience.


## Language
1. **~Why~** - do not use this word. As it forces people to justify their action.
1. **How** - helps to distant people from the actions they took, but also limit the scope of the inquiry, as we focus on mechanics, not the relations at play in larger system.
1. **What** - uncovers reasoning, which is important for building empathy with people in complex systems
    * What did you think was happening?
    * What did you do next?

Remember:
**People make what they consider to be the best decision given the information available to them at the time**


## Biases
1. **Fundamental Attribution Error** - when we explain other people's actions by their personality, not the context they find themselves in, but we explain our own actions by our context, not our personality.
1. **Confirmation bias** - when we seek information that reinforces existing positions, and ignore alternative explanations. We interpret ambiguous information in favour of our existing assumptions.
1. **Hindsight bias** - when we recall events to form a judgment, and talk about contextualize events with knowledge of the outcome - often making ourselves look better in the process.

## Practices
**Downtime is like a present - it's good until you have the same twice.**
1. Principles:
    * Blameless
        * people are never root cause
    * Should be written for all major or user-facing incidents
    * Should be reviewed
    * Should be shared withing an organization.
    * Can be used as a training material
1. Content:
    * What went wrong
    * What the impact of the issue was
    * How you tracked down the problem
    * How you fixed the problem
    * How to prevent it from happening again.
1. Conclusions:
    * What could have gone terribly wrong?
    * How can we do to avoid such issues in the future?
    * Follow Up Actions


## Analyzing and reducing the amount of incidents
1. Keep a History of Outages
1. Ask the Big, Even Improbable, Question: What if...?
1. Encourage Proactive Testing
