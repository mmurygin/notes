# Continuous Delivery

## Definition

**Continuous Delivery** - the ability to get changes - features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments - into production or into the hands of users safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

## Goals
1. Make releases painless, low risk events
1. Reduce time to market
1. Increase software quality and stability
1. Reduce cost of ongoing software development
1. Increase customer and employee satisfaction
    * create fast feedback loops


## Key Principles
1. Build quality in
    * the job is done when software pass all the integration, functional and performance tests
1. Work in small batches
1. Computer do repetitive tasks, people solve problems
1. Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement

## Metrics
1. Lead time (from commit to deploy)
    * how quickly can I rollout a fix?
    * how quickly can I get a critical fix to users?
        * how quickly can I validate whether a feature is valuable?


## Key Ingridients
1. Simplicity
