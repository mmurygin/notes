### Strategies
There could be two ways to deal with them
1. Find a way to live with this behavior
    * Practice detachment - I won't be feeling bad about myself because of their words / actions
    * Resist caving in or being aggressive back - accept their point of view, but don't give up.
    * Set clear objectives and calmly stick to them
    * Take time out
2. Change them
    * Point out their behavior and explain how you'd like to work instead.
    * Follow the framework:
        * I understand
        * I feel
        * I want
        * Is that OK?
