## Bad Listeners

### Why
**When you don't listen, you end up alienate people**

1. We always interrupt
    * e.g. you have a context about what person is talking and you want to share it
1. We're nervous
    * thinking about response
1. We don't agree
    * we starting debating


### Signs
1. Interrupting.
1. Changing topics.
    * especially when the topic is important for the person you are talking with
1. Debating before people finished they thoughts.


## Prepare for high-stakes conversation
1. Pick the right environment
1. Identify the right time so that the other participant is ready to talk about it
1. Be ready to focus


## Listen effectively
1. Be mindful of body language
    * smiling
    * making eye contact frequently
    * adopting an open posture: for example, leaning forward towards the speaker demonstrate your interest
    * not leaning back in your chair with your arms crossed in from of you as if to say 'Come on then, interest me'
1. **DO NOT INTERRUPT**
    * You gain nothing from interrupting
    * Take notes
    * Focus on breathing
1. Pause to think of questions, rather than formulating them in your mind while the speaker is talking.
    * Small pauses for thought can reassure your speaking partner that you are engaged by what they have said.
1. Ask open-ended questions
1. Use the "help me understand" approach
    * Can you tell me more?
    * OK, got on please.
    * Gotcha.
    * Why is that?
1. Develop empathy.
    * Try to gain a deeper understanding of how the speaker feels.
1. Assimilate, restate, and show you understand the impact
    * Can I just clarify? You're saying that...
    * My understanding is that ...
    * Let me make sure I've got this right; you're saying ...
    * So let's recap on what has been said and agreed.
1. Do not take people's language to the extreme
    * it's especially common, when we are criticized
1. Ask them for possible solutions
    * do not provide people with solutions until they asked
1. Build on what has been said
    * What you said about... is really interesting. I think we should discuss this more.



## How to listen when someone annoys you
1. They may be passionate about the topic, but you are not.
    * try to connect with their passition, e.g. by slightly switching the topic of discussion
1. They may not think you're listening
    * Restate their point
1. They may be angry
    * If you're at fault, apologize.
    * If you're not at fault, understand what they need.
1. They may have a varying worldview.
    * Listen and discover.
