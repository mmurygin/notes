# Prompt Engineering

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - provide details and context about your problem
2. **Assign a role** - role should be tailored to the output you want to receive (e.g. if you want to cover edge cases assign tester role, if you want to optimize assign role of efficiency programmer, if you want to explain - assign tutor role)
    * role examples:
        * software tester - for finding edge cases
        * tutor - for explaining / documenting code
        * architect - for finding architecture flaws, improving architecture
        * security expert - for fixing security issues
    * multiple roles are possible and helpful
3. **Iterate**

## Examples

1. Testing Prompt

```
As a software tester, analuze this function for potential edge cases and suggest robust handling strategies
```
